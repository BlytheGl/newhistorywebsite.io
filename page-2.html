            <strong>ü©µ What was the Quality of Life ü©µ</strong>
            <p>As Margret Thatcher was in power, she became a polarising figure for many. The life expectancy for the average British person rose from 72.9 to 75, which is a 2.8% increase, along with reducing the tax rate of 83% to 60% and 33% to 30%. However, the poverty rate and unemployment rates rose alongside these cuts. The quality of life for many citizens at the time was poor, with high crime, violent protests and riots, corruption of the law force, rampant racism, homophobia, and misogyny, mass unemployment, and rising interest rates. Many people suffered under the reign of Thatcher. During her time as prime minister, Margaret Thatcher respected human rights. She assisted in the improvement of women's rights as a form of human rights, as the first female prime minister of Britain, and was heavily against terrorism. However, the wealth of Britain was not evenly shared. With those in power holding much of the wealth, and underprivileged people remaining in extreme poverty. With a lack of wealth distribution and a poor quality of life for citizens living in lower class areas of Britain, much contempt grew towards Margaret Thatcher. Many local punk rock bands at the time were comprised of lower class and impoverished people, with many bands sharing guitars and other musical instruments. Therefore, many songs were created criticising Thatcher and her lack of care for those who faced monetary struggles due to her policies. There was severe social division between the wealthy and the poor. With many living in differing areas and having entirely different cultures,. There was social division between ‚ÄòThatcherites‚Äô, a common term used for those who supported Thatcher and her policies, and those who were anti-Thatcher. Many people shared differing political beliefs and monetary backgrounds, which caused a divide among many citizens.

          <strong>"Describe the politics of your chosen society. What type of government was in charge? Was it democratic?"</strong>
          <p>Margret Thatcher was a prime minister affiliated with the Conservative Party of the United Kingdom. It was a democratic vote, with Margaret Thatcher winning the election three times.

          <strong>Was it popular? Did the government discriminate against certain groups?</strong>
          <p>Margret Thatcher was a heavily controversial politician, with many of her policies benefiting some while neglecting others. While Margaret Thatcher did not publicly announce any discrimination against certain groups of people, her lack of action against the introduction of Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 was severely criticised, as she did not stand against the blatant homophobia it contained. Section 28 states that a local authority shall not intentionally promote homosexuality and/or publish any material depicting homosexuality, and that there should be no acceptance of homsexual teachings in the classroom as a ‚Äúpretend family‚Äù. As Thatcher did not promote any active racism, homophobia, or misogyny, she is often regarded as a ‚Äògood‚Äô conservative politician, however, her lack of action towards supporting and preventing the discrimination of certain groups shows her lack of political care for these groups. However, in the culture at the time, there was heavy discrimination. While the previous band mentioned, The Specials, was touring across Britain, they faced heavy racism from British citizens due to their black members. Margret Thatcher‚Äôs era was also at the time of the AIDS crisis, and this crisis caused mass homophobia in the culture of Britain. However, Margret Thatcher‚Äôs government effectively assisted in embracing measures to prevent the deaths of many from AIDS/HIV.</p>
