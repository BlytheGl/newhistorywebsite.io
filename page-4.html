            <strong>üéµ What is Punk Rock? üéµ</strong>
            <p>Punk rock is a genre of music defined by it's lack of melody and powerful bass, guitar, or voice. Music of the genre typically comments on societal issues and the state of the world and is often used as a platform to bring awareness to issues. During Margret Thatcher‚Äôs era of Prime Minister, there was an increase in punk rock music that commented on the decisions she made whilst in parliament. Many critiqued her impact on British economics and her contribution to a large employment and housing crisis. Ska is a genre of music similar to punk rock, with heavy inspiration from Jamaican music in the 1950s, and Two-Tone is a genre of music that combines both punk rock and ska.</p>

          <strong>Example 1Ô∏è‚É£</strong>
          <p>For example, Ghost Town by The Specials was a two-tone/ska song that reached the top of the charts in Britain on July 7th, 1981. The song features heavy commentary on the state of Thatcher‚Äôs Britain, with Jerry Dammers, the songwriter for The Specials, stating, ‚ÄúThe song was a comment on what was happening‚Äîthe injustice and the right-wing governments who didn‚Äôt care about the people but only cared about making money for their friends.‚Äù The right wing government referred to is Margaret Thatcher‚Äôs. Her heavy cuts to employment and industries had left many without money, and no prospect of assistance from the government. With the increasing poverty crisis, many towns were left behind by people or by those selling personal belongings to afford anything. This scene of poverty and misery inspired Ghost Town. 
            In the song, they describe the ghost town, singing:
            ‚ÄúThe streets are empty
            Where love once was but it's faded away
            These broken memories‚Äù
            This implies a melancholic scene of loneliness, a past of enjoyment that has been stripped away. This can be interpreted as a reference to the state that many towns of Britain were left in after the mass unemployment created by Margaret Thatcher. Her destruction of the manufacturing industry left many families broken and struggling, which could be referenced in the lines about lost love and broken memories.

        <div class="card--work-history">
          <strong>Example 2Ô∏è‚É£</strong>
          <p>The song ‚ÄúKick Out The Tories.‚Äù by Newtown Neurotics is a punk song which comments on the mass unemployment caused by Thatcher and others in power. The opening lyrics sing:
            ‚ÄúThe rulers of this land
            For they are the enemies
            Of the British‚ÄÖworking‚ÄÖman‚Äù
            A clear comment on the state of Britain at the time. Referring to the rulers of the time, mainly Thatcher, as enemies of the British woking man. As a cut throat comment against the mass unemployment that was occurring, the band later sings:
            ‚ÄúCan't you see what they're trying to do
            They just abuse their power‚Äù
            This lyric can be seen as a direct comment to the corruption of the British government and police at the time. With the large number of riots that occurred in most towns and the increased police brutality and abuse of weaponry by rioters,. This can also be seen as a direct reference to George Lindo, a black British man who was arrested by police for robbery despite a severe lack of evidence that pinned him to the crime. The corruption of the government can be seen as a statement surrounding Thatcherism and the conservative party that was in power in the United Kingdom.
