            <p>The article ‚ÄúThe Social Conditions which Inspired ‚ÄòGhost Town‚Äô are Still With Us Today, Says ‚ÄòThe Specials‚Äô Jerry Dammers.‚Äù by Chris Sullivan for Byline Times is a resource that assisted me in creating a well-thought out analysis on Ghost Town. It provides an insight into the band's experience that influenced them in creating the song and an insight into what was occurring during the Margret Thatcher era of the United Kingdom. It provides a clear view of the poverty and injustices that were occurring at the time. It‚Äôs an interview with the lyricist, the man who wrote the song, and it states his direct inspirations. It‚Äôs the experiences they had and the things they saw. Jerry Dammers, in the interview, paints a clear picture of the impoverishment that occurred during that time. He describes seeing desperation for money, with people selling their homewares and personal belongings to earn money after the destruction of the manufacturing industry by Margret Thatcher. Jerry Dammers describes the mass riots, the anger and angst that were brewing in the hearts of the youth at the time. He refers back to the lyrics of the song and correlates them with what they saw. He describes how Margaret Thatcher left many families to fall into poverty and unemployment, and how the government failed the citizens of Britain.

          <p>It relates the song and the experiences to the modern day, with lyrics that still remain true and applicable to the modern United Kingdom. The relation to modern day events allowed me to understand the anger and pain of those in Britain during the era of mass unemployment. Jeremy Dammers talks about how these were common motivations for many songs in punk-rock, ska, and two-tone movements, and how these injustices were commonly talked about by local bands. This allowed me to understand common motivations for lyrics and other occurrences in the punk scene and subculture. This article was incredibly useful in the creation of my website, and my analysis of ‚ÄòGhost Town‚Äô by The Specials is an example for the first question.

            <p>The song ‚ÄúWhine and Grine/Stand Down Margret‚Äù on the record ‚ÄúI Can‚Äôt Just Stop It.‚Äù by The Beat was incredibly insightful toward the attitudes of punk musicians towards Margret Thatcher. The lyrics in the song critique the actions taken by the government during that time, claiming that Margret Thatcher cares little for the people she governs. The lyrics reference the Falkland war that Thatcher sent British soldiers to fight in. With lines like ‚Äò‚ÄúWhat a World War Three.‚Äù it references the wars and violence that occurred at the time and in the past. The lyrics plead for Thatcher to stand down, as she is not improving the lives of the impoverished or underprivileged. It states how the band doubts she would care if she knew how many had lost time with their families, or passed away, as her actions are careless and unforgiving.

              The song assisted me in understanding the public contempt for Thatcher and how her actions were perceived at the time. It‚Äôs a musical artefact that paints a picture of the anger against Thatcher and her refusal to step down after three elections in parliament. The song falls into the ska genre, with a heavier Jamaican influence, and is typical for a ska song of that time. The lyrics that directly address Thatcher, and comment on her perceived cruelness by the public are incredibly useful in understanding the attitude of many punk, punk rock, ska, and two-tone bands at the time. The references to war in the city are references to the violent riots and protests that would occur in the streets of town, where police brutality was commonplace and brawls happened often. The violent protests and riots were due to social division and anger towards the negligent parliament. It was also common that Margret Thatcher, along with Queen Victoria || were referenced as figureheads for the corruption and poverty that ravaged the United Kingdom at the time.
