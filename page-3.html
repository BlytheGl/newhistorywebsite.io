            <strong>üß∑ Punk Rock & History üß∑</strong>
            <p>Much of the punk rock, ska and two-tone music created by British artists at the time was influenced by Margret Thatchers impact on society, the Falkan war that was occurring during the time, the AIDS/HIV crisis, and the culture of Britain being one of discrimination and poverty. Many songs commented on the struggle that had occurred for the last decade, as Britain had been falling into an economic downfall. A popular punk band, Sex Pistols, created many songs commenting on the Monarchy of Britain, and the general anarchy that was spawning in towns due to brewing anger against discrimination and the government. The Sex Pistols created their music before Margaret Thatcher came into power, however, their songs were heavily influenced by the history of Britain and the hatred that had been forming in popular culture. Once Margret Thatcher had come into power, many songs commented on her, many referencing her by name. Songs like ‚ÄúWhine and Grine/Stand Down Margret‚Äù by The Beat, a popular two-tone/ska band that condemns Margret Thatcher for her actions in parliament in the song. Most songs at the time were inspired by events that were happening at the time, and few addressed the actions of past prime ministers and actions by the British in the past. The song ‚ÄúDresden‚Äù by Drongos of Europe is a punk song that was directly influenced by the historical event of the tragic bombing of Dresden, a place in Germany.

          <p>The music produced during the Margaret Thatcher era was highly influential. It inspired more political commentary based songs, and promoted the use of music to criticise and condemn the actions of those in parliament and power. The punk movement revolved around an anti-capitalist mindset, which allowed many to disengage from the high interest rates and unemployment that were occurring. Now, the punk movement is still an incredibly popular movement, with many still supporting the ideas of the subculture.

        <div class="card--work-history">
          <p>The punk rock movement also allowed for the introduction of independent record labels, which greatly improved the money that could be made by independent musicians and the popularity of underground artists. Independent record labels allowed people in disadvantaged situations to become musicians. The punk movement assisted in changing the views and social norms of British society with the subculture's view of acceptance and support for everyone. It also assisted in promoting protests as a means of calling attention to an issue in society or parliament, which are still used today as a means of standing against an issue.
